# Hello from MDX!

This is a standard paragraph. But unlike normal Markdown, I can now use **React components** directly in this file.

### 1. Image Test

This image uses the Next.js `<Image />` component via our mapping. Make sure you have an image at `public/test-image.jpg` or use a placeholder URL.

<div className="flex justify-center py-4">
  ![A beautiful test image](/headshot-test.png)
</div>

<div className="flex justify-center py-4">
  ![A beautiful test image](/12345.png)
</div>

### 2. Math Test (KaTeX)

The pipeline should still handle math perfectly:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

### 3. Code Highlighting

```typescript
interface Developer {
  name: string;
  lovesMDX: boolean;
}

const me: Developer = {
  name: "Dave",
  lovesMDX: true,
};
```
