# This is a Header

If this text is big and bold, the **Tailwind Typography** (prose) plugin is working.

### Math Test (KaTeX)

Here is an inline equation: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

And here is a display equation:

$$
I = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx
$$

### Code Test

```javascript
console.log("If this has colors, syntax highlighting is active!");
```
